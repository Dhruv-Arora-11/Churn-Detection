1. we can see that in this , gender is not playing any role because , even if the gender is 1 or 0 , the distribution is equal


2. the ratio of sineor citizen and churning is much more than not senior citizen and dropping , so we need to focus on senior citizens and make decisions according to them


3. if the person does nto has pertner , then the dropping ratio is high but for couples , the dropping rate is much low . So need to focus on singles


4. if person has dependents , then first they does not even enroll much , and if they enroll , then they does not churn . so need to market for taking them to platform 
also the dropping rate of the person without dependents is high .


5. there are good amount of people that enroll for phone service , and the ratio is almost similar to the people that does not enroll for phone service , so does not gave a good insight


6. paperless billing also has a significant effect because the people with paper billing , are less churning .


7. in the tenure distribution , the distribution is left side skewed so firstly have to use log transform , then people with high tenure are less likely to churn and that's obvious


8. total charges are also less skewed and need teh log transform , it can make the perfect normal distribution
and another strange thing is that , the less total charges are more churning
